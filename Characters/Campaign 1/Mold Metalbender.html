   <p>Mold was first met by 
   <a href="Players/Wak Vak.html">Wak Vak</a> and 
   <a href="Players/Jaster.html">Jaster,</a> 
   as Wak wanted to go visit
   Tinkerbit about a new weaopon. Mold was busy working on something the
   two did not ask about. Wak asked Mold if he could put a ruby he stole
   from
   <a href="../../Places/Campaign 1/Henderbrick City.html">the Henderbrick</a>
   mines into a kitchen knife he also stole from the Henderbrick City
   guest quarters. Mold agrees and works on the knife overnight.</p>
