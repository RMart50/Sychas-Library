   <h2>History</h2>
   <p>Wak Vak, Jaster, and Adon first meet Sir Lannor when they wake up
   in a cave prison to find out they have all been kidnapped. Through the
   intervention of Wak and Adon, the group breaks him out of his cell and
   look for a way out of the cave. While traveling through the cave system,
   he gets his belongings back when the group finds a storage room with
   all of their things. Afterwards, the group is seemingly transported
   into an arena, but fellow prisoner,
   <a href="Daso Greenhill.html">Daso Greenhill,</a>
   goes missing in the process.<br>
   <br>
   Sir Lannor then helped Adon and Jaster fight undead summoned by the
   cult that kidnapped them. They are then transported to a sunken cave
   they must fight a giant spider. Sir Lannor then joins the group in
   climbing each other to reach the high up exit to the cave and get out.
   Through further searching through the cave, he witnesses Adon get 
   attacked and kill a man from the cult that was hiding. He then helps
   the group look through the cults leader's office after it fled. The 
   exit to the cave is found through hidden buttons in the office. Sir
   Lannor manages to survive the traps at the cave exit along with the
   rest of the group.<br>
   <br>
   After escaping the tunnels, the group finds that it leads to outside
   of the village of 
   <a href="../../Places/Campaign 1/Sachnoka.html">Sachnoka.</a> 
   They decide to stay at
   <a href="../../Places/Campaign 1/Buildings/Basec Beach Inn.html">the Basec Beach Inn</a>
   for the night. While eating supper Sir Lannor manages to convince his
   fellow survivors to travel with him to talk to 
   his lord <!--future link: Thamior Siannodel-->
   about the cult. The next day, the group goes into 
   <a href= "../../Places/Campaign 1/Henderbrick City.html">Henderbrick City,</a>
   the cave city directly connected to Sachnoka. The group then loses Sir
   Lannor as they get caught in a fight with goblins while exploring the
   city. With no way to find him or where his lord
   lives, <!--future link: Greemon-->
   the party decides to follow Wak's original plan of telling the leaders
   of where he 
   lives <!--future link: Dislon-->
   about the cult</p>
