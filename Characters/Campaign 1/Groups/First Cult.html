   <h1>Cult from the Beginning of the Game</h1>
   <p><img src="../Images/Chaos Cult Symbol.jpg" style="float:right;width:150px;height:150px;">
   A cult that
   <a href="../Players/Wak Vak.html">Wak Vak,</a>
   <a href="../Players/Adon Knobro.html">Adon Knobro,</a>
   and
   <a href="../Players/Jaster.html">Jaster </a>
   were kidnapped by. They also kidnapped
   <a href="../Sir Lannor.html">Sir Lannor</a>
   and
   <a href="../Daso Greenhill.html">Daso Greenhill</a>
   to be inprisoned with the player characters and, as it turned out, later sacrificed.
   Daso was revealed to be a member and was killed. Meanwhile, the cults leader escaped
   and the group has no idea about the cult other than they have somewhat of a relation
   to Adon's past, since he recognized the 
   symbol on their mask.</p>

   <h2>Known(?) Members</h2>
   The party has only interacted with 4 members of the cult. They have
   seen someone who seems to be the leader. They have defeated, well Aidon
   did, Daso Greenhill after he attacks Aidon. Lastly, they got completely
   stomped, to the edge of death, by 2 random members. One member showed
   to use electric based magic while the other mostly used teleportation
   magic and stayed out of the fight.
