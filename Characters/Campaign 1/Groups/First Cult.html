      <a href="../Players/Adon Knobro.html">Adon Knobro,</a>
      and
      <a href="../Players/Jaster.html">Jaster </a>

      <a href="../Sir Lannor.html">Sir Lannor</a>
      and
      <a href="../Daso Greenhill.html">Daso Greenhill</a>
      to be inprisoned with the player characters and, as it turned out, later sacrificed.
      Daso was revealed to be a member and was killed. Meanwhile, the cults leader escaped
      and the group has no idea about the cult other than they have somewhat of a relation
      to Adon's past, since he recognized the 
      symbol on their mask.<!--future link: cult symbol--></p>
