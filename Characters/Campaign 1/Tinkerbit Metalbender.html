   respectively. She is an inventor and blacksmith like all the members 
   of her family. She has a close relationship to

   <h2>History</h2>
   <p>Tinkerbit was first met by Wak and
   <a href="Players/Jaster.html">Jaster,</a>
   as Wak Vak goes to the Metalbender compound to tell her about losing
   her prototype, ask for another one, and ask her father about placing
   a ruby in a kitchen knife he stole. Tinkerbit gets very mad about Wak
   losing her prototype, but does agree to make a new one for him to
   test out. She explains that it will take some time and will find a
   way to send the new prototype to Wak. Jaster then asks her, in secret,
   to help polish his armor. She agrees to do it for a price, where she
   considers the fact that most people are offended by the fact he still
   wears and cares for his "ancient draconian ancestrial" armor, something
   her aunt did not agree to do.</p>
