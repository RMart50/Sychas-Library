   <h1>Jaster</h1>
   <p>Jaster is the player character of Andrew Torrez and his <i>"Greartword", 
      if you know what I mean</i> ;). He is a white/silver scaled Dragonborn
      uses cold breath to freeze his enemies. He also has the ability to heal
      his allies.
      <br><br>
      Jaster has shown to be horny at times, but his awkwardness seems to get
      in the way. He wears a cloak, that he started wearing in Sachnoka, over 
      his armor.</p>
