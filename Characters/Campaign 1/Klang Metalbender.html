   <h2>History</h2>
   <p>Wak Vak notices Klang when the party first enters the Basec Beach
   Inn, but tries to hide from him. However,
   <a href="Players/Adon Knobro.html">Adon Knobro</a>
   causes a big scene while experimenting with his staff. This causes Klang
   to notice Wak. They have a short conversation, where Klang mentions
   that Wak could be in trouble with someone for losing something, then
   Klang leaves the group to talk about their upcoming plans.</p>
