   <p>Alberich is one of 
   <a href="Groups/Henderbrick Leaders.html">the nine rulers</a> of 
   <a href="../../Places/Campaign 1/Henderbrick City.html">Henderbrick City,</a> 
   along with his
   twin sister. <!--will eventually be a link if the party ever decides they
   want to learn the other rulers names-->
   He hires the party to help him with what he believes is a growing goblin
   problem in the city. He is, at most times, accompanied by his assassin,
   Kada, <!--future link-->
   and personal guard,
   Grakilm. <!--future link-->

   <h2>History</h2>
   <p>The Party (well 
   <a href="Players/Adon Knobro.html">Adon,</a> 
   <a href="Players/Wak Vak.html">Wak,</a> and 
   <a href="Players/Jaster.html">Jaster;</a> 
   they hadn't met Baelon yet) 
   first meets Alberich after they are arrested in Henderbrick City for 
   a misunderstanding from fighting goblins. Alberich argued with his 
   sister during the trial that the party has helped them, with 
   an older ruler <!--maybe a future link: Vistra-->
   backing him up. Alberich shows concern that the goblins appearing is 
   a part of a bigger problem happenning in the back of the mines. As his
   sister will not allow any guards to go check on his "superstitions",
   Alberich offers to pay the Party 7 Gold to go with him to check instead.
   The rest of the rulers agreed to this, and Wak convinced his two companions
   to take the job for the money. He lets the Party stay in a guest suite
   of the rulers building.<br>
   <br>
   The next morning, the Party joined Alberich and his two guards, Kada
   and Grakilm, for talking to the managers of the mine about the problem
   and making a plan. They decide to journey past the mine to the rest of
   the cave. It is during this journey that they find
   <a href="Players/Baelon.html">Baelon</a>
   has been living there. With not much convincing, Baelon joined their
   troop.<br>
   <br>
   The group, along with their new member, then proceeded farther down
   the cave. They then came upon an unknown camp, and sent Wak Vak
   to check out. As he finds the camp has two Duergar, Dark Dwarves, in
   command of a few goblins. However, it is also at this point that the
   camp notices the glow of Adon down the cave and go to attack the rest
   of the group. During this fight, Alberich struggled actually hitting
   his opponents, but did not back down and had some help from Grakilm to
   keep him from dying.<br>
   <br>
   As the last Duergar was killed, he mentions how more are on the way.
   Alberich tells the Party to take an injured Kada with them back to the 
   city to warn of the incoming danger, while Grakilm and him stay back 
   to slow them down. Wak convinced the rest of the Partyto stay behind 
   and let Kada go by herself, of course to try and make more money from 
   the job. The Party came up with a plan only to find out they greatly
   underestimated how much reinforcements were on the way, 
   an entire army. <!--future link: Henderbrick Duergar Army-->
   The Party then decides to run away as fast as they can back to the city
   while trying to keep their cash cow, I mean Alberich, safe. They
   eventually run into the Army of Henderbrick City ready for war with the
   Party's persuers. Once they reach safety, Alberich has Grakilm take
   the Party out of the city and pay them while he stays to keep fighting.</p>
