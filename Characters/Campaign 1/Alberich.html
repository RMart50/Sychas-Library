   <a href="../../Places/Campaign 1/Henderbrick City.html">Henderbrick City,</a> 
   along with his
   twin sister. <!--will eventually be a link if the party ever decides they
   want to learn the other rulers names-->
   He hires the party to help him with what he believes is a growing goblin
   problem. He is, at most times, accompanied by his assassin,
   Kada, <!--future link-->
