   <h1>The Current Story of Campaign 1</h1>
   
   <h2>Session 1: <i>Strangers in an Underground Prison</i></h2>
   <p>Five strangers wake up in an underground prison, lined with lava 
   rock. We begin with 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Jaster.html">Jaster </a>
   waking up to meet 
   Sir Lannor <!--future link-->
   and 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Daso Greenhill.html">Daso Greenhill.</a>
   He is then followed by 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Adon Knobro.html">Adon Knobro,</a> 
   then 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Wak Vak.html">Wak Vak.</a>
   Jaster is a <mark>silver/white (Robert will figure this out)</mark> dragonborn
   with a scar across his face. Adon Knobro is a fire genasi that was a 
   human before being kidnapped. Wak Vak is a dark gnome with slicked back, 
   black hair, a big nose,and scars. Sir Lanor is a human knight who seems 
   nice, while Daso Greenhill is a halfling rogue that continuously argues 
   with Wak upon waking. This back and forth banter leads to Daso telling 
   on Wak as he sneaks out of his cell and seams to leave the rest of the 
   group. The guards come into the room after Wak tries to hide his lockpic 
   beforehand. Adon then notices
   the masks <!--future link: cult symbol-->
   that the guards are wearing look familiar to him.<br>
   <br>
   After Wak is searched, Adon tries using his newfound magic to steal 
   the cell keys. He fails, but burns the guard to death as it walks to 
   his cell. After seeing a fire genasi take the cell keys from their 
   ally's corpse, the other two guards ran for help. Adon then escapes 
   his cell, chases, and incinerates the other two guards before they 
   could seek help. He then proceeded to release the other prisoners from
   their cells.<br>
   <br>
   Once everyone was free, they start to search through the rest of the
   cave to find a way out. Across from their prison, the group slowly walk
   through a hallway that seems to lead to a large arena filled with 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Groups/First Cult.html">people</a>
   chanting an unknown word. They decide to turn back and climb up a ladder
   they passed earlier. In the higher level of the cave, the group walk 
   into a huge room full of tables. They move onto another room, which 
   they discover to be a storage with chests full of their belongings 
   before they were captured. Wak is only person to have one of his 
   belongings missing and also breaks his thieves tools trying to break open
   a chest. As everyone gathers their possessions, they hear a loud voice
   seemingly come from nowhere before the cave goes completely dark.<br>
   <br>
   As the darkness goes away, the group finds themselves in an underground 
   coliseum, that seems to be the one they walked away from earlier as 
   the crowd is still yelling their chant, with Daso missing. A figure 
   in an arena box talks to the crowd and anounces the start of an event. 
   At this point, the bones around the prisoners gather together to create 
   undead fighters that attack. Adon and Sir Lanor demolish the skeletons 
   while Jax struggles and Wak runs away. After their victory, the arena 
   goes black.<br>
   <br>
   When the darkness goes away again, the group finds themselves at the 
   bottom of a big cave. As they are trying to figure out what happened, 
   a giant spider attacks them. After defeating the monster, the group 
   discovers the exit to the cave is high. They climb on top of each other 
   to get out, and then roam the rest of the caverns.<br>
   <br>
   The group eventually walks towards a room, where they see and hear an 
   individual talking to an unknown person. As Adon walked into the room, 
   he gets stabbed by a masked figure who seems to be Daso. <i>(Funny 
   enough, Adon was the only person who believed that Daso was not a part 
   of the masked group.)</i> In his anger, Adon burns the figure to death 
   in one shot. The other individual in the room notices what has happened 
   in the room and disappeared.<br>
   <br>
   The group started looking through the room for things they could loot. 
   They find extra mask and some blank scrolls, and decide to take an 
   extra mask to have as evidence for getting help. Wak also found secret 
   switches underneath two extra tables in the room that open a hole in 
   the back wall. The group goes to explore the tunnel behind the door. 
   Wak goes first and sets off many traps, but he survives. This leaves 
   the rest of the group to walk through the tunnel with no problems. 
   They exit to a cliffside that leads down to the beach town
   <a href="Places/Campaign 1/Sachnoka.html">Sachnoka.</a></p>
   
   <hr>
   <h2>Session 2: <i>Ruckus into the Dwarven City</i> (Short Session)</h2>
   <p>Upon finding the exit to their underground prison, the group decides 
   to find a place to rest for the night in Sachnoka. They go down the 
   cliffside and decide to stay at the
   <a href="Places/Campaign 1/Buildings/Basec Beach Inn.html">Basec Beach Inn.</a>
   Upon entering the establishment, Wak notices a gnome and decides to 
   try and keep his precense hidden in the back corner of restuarant. 
   However, Adon decides to try using magic with his staff creating a 
   small explosion that only hurts the people at the table. This ruins 
   Wak's cover, and he is noticed by the dwarf. He introduces himself as
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Klang Metalbender.html">Klang Metalbender</a>
   and he gets concerned when Wak says that he lost a secret project.<br>
   <br>
   While all this happens, Jaster is outside because he goes to meet a 
   mysterious figure in a cloak that bumped into him as he walked in. He 
   reenters the restuarant, now wearing a cloak, as Wak's conversation 
   ends with Klang.<br>
   <br>
   Now that the group is all together, they start discussing about how 
   to deal with the cult that kidnapped them. Wak believes that they should 
   travel to his home town of 
   Dislon<!--future link: Dislon-->
   so they can bring this issue up with the thieves' guild. However, Sir 
   Lannor convinces him that it would be a better idea that they go meet 
   with 
   his Lord <!--future link: Thamior Siannodel-->
   and ask him for help, since it would be a quicker trip. 
   The group then finishes eating then each go to sleep: with Adon buying 
   a room, Wak paying to sleep on the floor of the broom closet, and 
   Jaster deciding to sleep in the stables for free.<br>
   <br>
   The next morning the group meets up and heads towards the gates of
   <a href="Places/Campaign 1/Henderbrick City.html">Henderbrick City</a>
   so they can meet Sir Lannor's fellow knights in the connecting 
   city.<!--future link: Julgust-->
   They use the help of a dwarf that bullied Adon the knight before to 
   vouch for their entry into the city. In the underground city, the group 
   end up in the middle of a fight with goblins that are rampaging through 
   the market stalls they are checking out. Adon and Jaster kill most of 
   them as Wak initially runs away, but then decides to go help them, and 
   Sir Lannor went ahead to find his colleagues. Towards the end of the 
   fight,
   an assassin looking dwarf <!--future link: Kada-->
   appears out of a cloud of smoke behind a goblin and appears to trip.
   Another warior looking dwarf <!--future link: Grakilm Steelback-->
   shows up and appears and kills a different goblin before requesting 
   the goblin be captured alive, which a random tiefling does.</p>

   <h2>Session 3: <i>Dealing with Dwarven Problems</i></h2>
   <p>Once the fight with the goblins ends, the Henderbrick Guard shows 
   up and surrounds the party. The guard that helped them, escorts the 
   three to go talk to the rulers of the city. One of the nine rulers, 
   who's name is later revealed to be
   Alberich, <!--future link: Lower Alberich-->
   wants the three adventurers to help with the goblin problem they have 
   been having lately. Another ruler, revealed to be his sister, does not 
   like the idea, but relents. Wak agrees for the group after coming to 
   an agreement of payment.<br>
   <br>
   The group is then led to where they will spend the night. While walking,
   Jaster makes an attempt at flirting with the guard that helped them 
   with the goblins earlier in the day, after failing to do so with the 
   rulers' receptionist earlier. This attempt also does not seem to work. 
   Over night, the three read a book about
   the history of the dragonborn empire <!--future link: Draconian Empire-->
   and later 
   kingdom. <!--future link: the Kingdom of Draconia-->
   Adon and Jaster then discussed about how their knowledge and the books 
   information differ. Meanwhile, Wak stole a kitchen knife from their 
   kitchen.<br>
   <br>
   The next morning, the trio is taken down to the mines to meet with 
   Alberich, the assassin and guard from the day before, and managers of 
   the mine. After going over a very basic game plan, the adventurers head 
   to the cave past the back of the mine with Alberich, the assassin, and 
   the guard. While venturing, the assassin stops the group as she proceeds 
   to venture further, quietly. It turns out to be a hill dwarf named
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Baelon.html">Baelon</a>
   that has been living near an aquifer in the cave. He agrees to join 
   the party and they all take a rest at his camp ground for a short while. 
   During this time, the group finds out that the assassins name is Kada 
   and the guards name is Grakilm Steelback. They are the two personal 
   guards of Alberich, where Kada's sect is sworn to a vow of silence.</p>

   <h2>Session 4: <i>Gambling on Rough Waters</i></h2>
   <p></p>
   
   <hr>
   <h2>Session 5: <i>Preparing to Enter the Desert</i> (Short Session)</h2>
   <p>As the party wakes, up Jaster does his morning "exercises" before
   meeting everyone else for a meeting. They discuss about the best way
   of going to Dislon, and determine they'll just have to cut directly
   through the desert. Before leaving the city, the party goes to the
   general store,
   Sally's Seashells, <!--future link-->
   to stock on a little bit of supplies just in case. Baelon also starts
   work on creating healing potions from the supplies he bought the day
   before. As the party leaves the city, Adon finds that he got swindled
   for a compass at Sally's.<br>
   <br>
   The party travels through plains for a few hours before finally being
   able to see the edge of the desert. As they get closer, they begin to
   notice a person is being attacked by something small. While Wak thinks
   it is best to go around and not get involved in the incident, Adon
   tries to get a closer look to see what is attacking the person. However,
   he is unsuccessful at being sneaky because his body of fire causes smoke
   from burning the grass. Three of the for creatures go to attack him
   the rest of the party joins in to fight. The party discovers the
   creatures are dust mephits. Baelon turns into a wolf and does some good
   damage while constantly being blinded and put to sleep. Adon does hit
   the  mephits a few times while also having to deal with being blinded,
   but his attacks are not that strong. Wak helps the rest of the party
   for a few seconds, before deciding to go help the stranger ahead. Lastly;
   Jaster, after feeling the gains from his earlier workout, demolishes
   the mephits and manages to help Wak kill the last one before it can kill
   the stranger.</p>
