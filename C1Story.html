   <h1>The Current Story of Campaign 1</h1>
   
   <h2>Session 1: <i>Strangers in an Underground Prison</i></h2>
   <p>Five strangers wake up in an underground prison, lined with lava 
   rock. We begin with 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Jaster.html">Jaster </a>
   waking up to meet 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Sir Lannor.html">Sir Lannor </a>
   and 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Daso Greenhill.html">Daso Greenhill.</a>
   He is then followed by 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Adon Knobro.html">Adon Knobro,</a> 
   then 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Wak Vak.html">Wak Vak.</a>
   Jaster is a silver dragonborn with a scar across his face. Adon Knobro 
   is a fire genasi that was a human before being kidnapped. Wak Vak is a 
   dark gnome with slicked back, black hair, a big nose,and scars. Sir 
   Lanor is a human knight who seems nice, while Daso Greenhill is a halfling 
   rogue that continuously argues with Wak upon waking. This back and forth 
   banter leads to Daso telling on Wak as he sneaks out of his cell and seams 
   to leave the rest of the group. The guards come into the room after Wak 
   tries to hide his lockpic beforehand. Adon then notices
   the masks <!--future link: cult symbol-->
   that the guards are wearing look familiar to him.<br>
   <br>
   After Wak is searched, Adon tries using his newfound magic to steal 
   the cell keys. He fails, but burns the guard to death as it walks to 
   his cell. After seeing a fire genasi take the cell keys from their 
   ally's corpse, the other two guards ran for help. Adon then escapes 
   his cell, chases, and incinerates the other two guards before they 
   could seek help. He then proceeded to release the other prisoners from
   their cells.<br>
   <br>
   Once everyone was free, they start to search through the rest of the
   cave to find a way out. Across from their prison, the group slowly walk
   through a hallway that seems to lead to a large arena filled with 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Groups/First Cult.html">people</a>
   chanting an unknown word. They decide to turn back and climb up a ladder
   they passed earlier. In the higher level of the cave, the group walk 
   into a huge room full of tables. They move onto another room, which 
   they discover to be a storage with chests full of their belongings 
   before they were captured. Wak is only person to have one of his 
   belongings missing and also breaks his thieves tools trying to break open
   a chest. As everyone gathers their possessions, they hear a loud voice
   seemingly come from nowhere before the cave goes completely dark.<br>
   <br>
   As the darkness goes away, the group finds themselves in an underground 
   coliseum, that seems to be the one they walked away from earlier as 
   the crowd is still yelling their chant, with Daso missing. A figure 
   in an arena box talks to the crowd and anounces the start of an event. 
   At this point, the bones around the prisoners gather together to create 
   undead fighters that attack. Adon and Sir Lanor demolish the skeletons 
   while Jax struggles and Wak runs away. After their victory, the arena 
   goes black.<br>
   <br>
   When the darkness goes away again, the group finds themselves at the 
   bottom of a big cave. As they are trying to figure out what happened, 
   a giant spider attacks them. After defeating the monster, the group 
   discovers the exit to the cave is high. They climb on top of each other 
   to get out, and then roam the rest of the caverns.<br>
   <br>
   The group eventually walks towards a room, where they see and hear an 
   individual talking to an unknown person. As Adon walked into the room, 
   he gets stabbed by a masked figure who seems to be Daso. <i>(Funny 
   enough, Adon was the only person who believed that Daso was not a part 
   of the masked group.)</i> In his anger, Adon burns the figure to death 
   in one shot. The other individual in the room notices what has happened 
   in the room and disappeared.<br>
   <br>
   The group started looking through the room for things they could loot. 
   They find extra mask and some blank scrolls, and decide to take an 
   extra mask to have as evidence for getting help. Wak also found secret 
   switches underneath two extra tables in the room that open a hole in 
   the back wall. The group goes to explore the tunnel behind the door. 
   Wak goes first and sets off many traps, but he survives. This leaves 
   the rest of the group to walk through the tunnel with no problems. 
   They exit to a cliffside that leads down to the beach town
   <a href="Places/Campaign 1/Sachnoka.html">Sachnoka.</a></p>
   
   <hr>
   <h2>Session 2: <i>Ruckus into the Dwarven City</i> (Short Session)</h2>
   <p>Upon finding the exit to their underground prison, the group decides 
   to find a place to rest for the night in Sachnoka. They go down the 
   cliffside and decide to stay at the
   <a href="Places/Campaign 1/Buildings/Basec Beach Inn.html">Basec Beach Inn.</a>
   Upon entering the establishment, Wak notices a gnome and decides to 
   try and keep his precense hidden in the back corner of restuarant. 
   However, Adon decides to try using magic with his staff creating a 
   small explosion that only hurts the people at the table. This ruins 
   Wak's cover, and he is noticed by the dwarf. He introduces himself as
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Klang Metalbender.html">Klang Metalbender</a>
   and he gets concerned when Wak says that he lost a secret project.<br>
   <br>
   While all this happens, Jaster is outside because he goes to meet a 
   mysterious figure in a cloak that bumped into him as he walked in. He 
   reenters the restuarant, now wearing a cloak, as Wak's conversation 
   ends with Klang.<br>
   <br>
   Now that the group is all together, they start discussing about how 
   to deal with the cult that kidnapped them. Wak believes that they should 
   travel to his home town of 
   Dislon<!--future link: Dislon-->
   so they can bring this issue up with the thieves' guild. However, Sir 
   Lannor convinces him that it would be a better idea that they go meet 
   with 
   his Lord <!--future link: Thamior Siannodel-->
   and ask him for help, since it would be a quicker trip. 
   The group then finishes eating then each go to sleep: with Adon buying 
   a room, Wak paying to sleep on the floor of the broom closet, and 
   Jaster deciding to sleep in the stables for free.<br>
   <br>
   The next morning the group meets up and heads towards the gates of
   <a href="Places/Campaign 1/Henderbrick City.html">Henderbrick City</a>
   so they can meet Sir Lannor's fellow knights in the connecting 
   city.<!--future link: Julgust-->
   They use the help of a dwarf that bullied Adon the knight before to 
   vouch for their entry into the city. In the underground city, the group 
   end up in the middle of a fight with goblins that are rampaging through 
   the market stalls they are checking out. Adon and Jaster kill most of 
   them as Wak initially runs away, but then decides to go help them, and 
   Sir Lannor went ahead to find his colleagues. Towards the end of the 
   fight,
   an assassin looking dwarf <!--future link: Kada-->
   appears out of a cloud of smoke behind a goblin and appears to trip.
   Another warior looking dwarf <!--future link: Grakilm Steelback-->
   shows up and appears and kills a different goblin before requesting 
   the goblin be captured alive, which a random tiefling does.</p>

   <hr>
   <h2>Session 3: <i>Dealing with Dwarven Problems</i></h2>
   <p>Once the fight with the goblins ends, the Henderbrick Guard shows 
   up and surrounds the Party. The guard that helped them, escorts the 
   three to go talk to 
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Groups/Henderbrick Leaders.html">the rulers of the city.</a> 
   One of the nine rulers, 
   who's name is later revealed to be
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Alberich.html">Alberich,</a>
   wants the three adventurers to help with the goblin problem they have 
   been having lately. 
   Another ruler, <!--future link: Audhild-->
   revealed to be his sister, does not 
   like the idea, but relents. Wak agrees for the group after coming to 
   an agreement of payment.<br>
   <br>
   The group is then led to where they will spend the night. While walking,
   Jaster makes an attempt at flirting with the guard that helped them 
   with the goblins earlier in the day, after failing to do so with the 
   rulers' receptionist earlier. This attempt also does not seem to work. 
   Over night, the three read a book about
   the history of the dragonborn empire <!--future link: Draconian Empire-->
   and later 
   kingdom. <!--future link: the Kingdom of Draconia-->
   Adon and Jaster then discussed about how their knowledge and the books 
   information differ. Meanwhile, Wak stole a kitchen knife from their 
   kitchen.<br>
   <br>
   The next morning, the trio is taken down to the mines to meet with 
   Alberich, the assassin and guard from the day before, and managers of 
   the mine. After going over a very basic game plan, the adventurers head 
   to the cave past the back of the mine with Alberich, the assassin, and 
   the guard. While venturing, the assassin stops the group as she proceeds 
   to venture further, quietly. It turns out to be a hill dwarf named
   <a href="Characters/Campaign 1/Players/Baelon.html">Baelon</a>
   that has been living near an aquifer in the cave. He agrees to join 
   the Party and they all take a rest at his camp ground for a short while. 
   During this time, the group finds out that the assassins name is Kada 
   and the guards name is Grakilm Steelback. They are the two personal 
   guards of Alberich, where Kada's sect is sworn to a vow of silence.
   (It is believed that this has led to Wak trying multiple times to get Kada
   to talk, or he is trying to impress her romantically. ;) <br>
   <br>
   Once the Party is rested up, they continue moving through the cave to
   discover a camp. As Wak goes to scout out the camp, its inhabitants notice
   the bright glow of Adon. Wak goes unnoticed as the rest of the group is
   chased and attacked by the goblins and dark dwarves from the camp. During
   the fight, Kada and Alberich struggle greatly with Alberich needing
   Grakilm's help. Wak decides to help Kada before trying to get her to talk
   again.<br>
   <br>
   As the last dark dwarf is killed, he mentions, "They are already on their
   way." Alberich tells the group that they have fulfilled their end of the
   deal. They are now free to go back as long as they take Kada with them to
   warn the other rulers of what is to come. Wak convinces the group to
   stay and help, out of an ulterior motive to try and get more reward
   money. The group comes up with a plan for slowing down the oncoming
   dark dwarves should they be an army. Although, the plan does not work
   well enough and Baelon has to Wild Shape into wolf in order to outrun
   them. The group then runs into the Henderbrick Army,led by Alberich's
   sister, ready to go to war with their pursuers. The Party then leaves
   Henderbrikc to the Basec Beach Inn, with Baelon deciding to join them 
   and Wak successfuly stealing a ruby from the mines.</p>

   <hr>
   <h2>Session 4: <i>Gambling on Rough Waters</i></h2>
   <p>The next morning, the Party meets up to talk about their next steps
   now that they do not know what happened to Sir Lannor. Wak convinces
   everyone that the thieves' guild should be able to help them, so they
   head towards Dislon. The Party decides to ride a boat that takes them
   across the 
   Hilo Gulf <!--maybe a future link-->
   Adon tries, and fails,
   to convince the boat staff to give him a discount. He bothers the staff
   so much that when Jaster asks for a discount, they secretly agree and
   give everyone but Adon a discount.<br>
   <br>
   The Party boards the boat and rides peacefully for a few hours. As the
   port city of
   <a href="Places/Campaign 1/Pecra Tenna.html">Pecra Tenna</a>
   becomes viewable, the water starts to be disturbed near the boat. One
   of the sailers goes to check on the disturbance. As he leaned over the
   edge of the boat, he seams to fall over into the water. The group is
   then attacked by Sahuagin, shark people. Wak
   loses two of his daggers by trowing them in the water. Adon struggles
   with using his magic, but becomes useful at the end when he switches
   to using weapons. Jaster kept chopping down at 2 Sahuagins' shoulders 
   until he reached their fatal organs, or possibly killed them by blood 
   loss. After the fight, the group helps the surviving sailor get them 
   to Pecra Tenna, where they are given coupons for a free ride due to 
   the attack.<br>
   <br>
   Once in the city, the group splits up with Adon and Baelon going to
   Potions on the Ocean. <!--future link-->
   Adon tries to barter with the owner,
   Miath, <!--future link-->
   once he notices he does not have enough money to afford one health potion.
   (This is when he finds out the boat they road in on is always attacked,
   and gives almost everyone coupons.) Baelon ends up buying health potion
   ingredients, to make potions later, after Adon fails. Meanwhile, Wak
   and Jaster go to
   Swords on the Shore <!--future link-->
   to try and buy some new weapons. Jaster , for the first time succeessfuly,
   hits on and secures a late night romance session with with the blacksmith
   and shop's owner,
   Quench Metalbender. <!--future link-->
   The groups then switched places, with Wak also unsuccessfuly bartering
   at Potions on the Ocean. However, Adon asks Quench about the properties
   of his staff. She handed the staff to her assistant,
   Quinn Redstream, <!--future link-->
   who finds it reactive to fire magic.<br>
   <br>
   The Party then regrouped only to split up again as nightfall began.
   Adon goes to the end of the docks to test his staff. After a couple 
   of tries where nothing happens, he finally casts a more powerful 
   Burning Hands spell. He then tries to conjure a fire tornado (that's 
   what Adam said don't blame me) and instead farts in front of a couple 
   of guards. While this happened, Jaster went for his late night rendezvous 
   with Quench. But, he reveals his armor, which he finds out is very 
   controversial and could get him in a lot of trouble. This prompts Quench
   to back out of sexual relations with Jaster, so he leaves to meet
   Adon at an inn called
   the Sea Bed. <!--future link--><br>
   <br>
   While they were busy working on their personal goals, Wak and Baelon 
   decided to walk around the town. During this walk, Wak looks for secret
   Thieves' Guild markings. He ends up seeing markings that point towards a
   gambling event on a 
   big ship. <!--future link-->
   The two of them enter to find that the boat has a fighting pit run by
   Sir Johnathan Aslan Mufasa Alexander Liono IV. <!--future link-->
   For some reason, Wak thought that he could convince Sir Johnathan to tell
   him "who has the fight rigged to be the winner." After Baelon has a side
   conversation on the side to talk some sense into Wak, he comes up with a
   plan to steal money from the richest people at the fights. Baelon made
   both of them invisible so they could sneak into the high rollers area.
   Without being cought, they steal money from all the rich people and find
   that Johnathan has no money on him. They deduce that all bets are placed
   in a seperate room that they manage to unlock, but fail to sneak past the
   guards. Not wanting to push their luck, Baelon and Wak sneak off the boat,
   while still invisible and head towards the Sea Bed to go to sleep.</p>
   
   <hr>
   <h2>Session 5: <i>Preparing to Enter the Desert</i> (Short Session)</h2>
   <p>As the Party wakes, up Jaster does his morning "exercises" before
   meeting everyone else for a meeting. They discuss about the best way
   of going to Dislon, and determine they'll just have to cut directly
   through the desert. Before leaving the city, the Party goes to the
   general store,
   Sally's Seashells, <!--future link-->
   to stock on a little bit of supplies just in case. Baelon also starts
   work on creating healing potions from the supplies he bought the day
   before. As the Party leaves the city, Adon finds that he got swindled
   for a compass at Sally's.<br>
   <br>
   The Party travels through plains for a few hours before finally being
   able to see the edge of the desert. As they get closer, they begin to
   notice 
   a person <!--future link: Gavin Truegast-->
   is being attacked by something small. While Wak thinks
   it is best to go around and not get involved in the incident, Adon
   tries to get a closer look to see what is attacking the person. However,
   he is unsuccessful at being sneaky because his body of fire causes smoke
   from burning the grass. Three of the for creatures go to attack him
   the rest of the Party joins in to fight. The Party discovers the
   creatures are dust mephits. Baelon turns into a wolf and does some good
   damage while constantly being blinded and put to sleep. Adon does hit
   the  mephits a few times while also having to deal with being blinded,
   but his attacks are not that strong. Wak helps the rest of the Party
   for a few seconds, before deciding to go help the stranger ahead. Lastly;
   Jaster, after feeling the gains from his earlier workout, demolishes
   the mephits and manages to help Wak kill the last one before it can kill
   the stranger.</p>
   
   <hr>
   <h2>Session 6: <i>"High" Flying to the Phoenix to Dust</i></h2>
   <p>The Party is convinced by Adon to wait for the stranger they saved
   to wake. He introduces himself as Gavin Truegast, and its made very
   obvious he is a stoner. He tells the group he was on his way to the
   Pool of Phoenix Ashes for
   <a href="Events/Campaign 1/the Phoenix Festival.html">the Phoenix Festival</a>
   to get some Phoenix Ashes for "recreational purposes", snort them. Adon
   convinces the group to tag along so he can talk to a Phoenix about the
   last events he remembered before turning into a Fire Genasi.<br>
   <br>
   Gavin leads the group to an empty space in the desert, where the group
   sees a small camp of people not far away. <mark>Robert needs to finish this Session</mark></p>
   <!--Need a reminder on how the group ran into Baron Darius and his hired muscle-->
   <hr>
   <h2>Session 7: <i>Adon's Troubles with Tribes and Guilds</i></h2>
<!--   <p>As the Party passes out from <b>GETTING WRECKED</b>, <mark>_____</mark>
   sees the visage of a figure walking towards the group.</p> -->
