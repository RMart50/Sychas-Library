   <h1>Phoenix Festival</h1>
   <p>The Phoenix Festival is about a month long event that takes place
   in the Pool of Phoenix Ashes in the desert in the east of Naxgale. 
   It is a festival in only name, as many people just show up randomly 
   during this time. Although, many people can be there at a time if 
   they show up before the Phoenixes. The reason being that the festival 
   revolves around people going to watch the Phoenixes death and rebirth 
   that happens once a year and/or collecting the ashes that are left 
   after they leave.</p>
